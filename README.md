# huglogic.github.io
HugLogic is a non-intrusive back-end support design for people who help others. It does not diagnose or treat. Instead, it preserves the conditions that allow support to continue by maintaining the helper’s rhythm, balance, and reflective space. A quiet structure for sustainable care.
